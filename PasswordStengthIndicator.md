# Password Strength Indicator Control Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed specification for a Password Strength Indicator user control to be built using C# and WPF on the .NET Core v6.0 platform. The purpose of this control is to provide real-time feedback to users as they type a password, indicating the strength of the password and whether it meets the specified password policies.

## Features

The Password Strength Indicator control will have the following features:

1. **Real-time password strength feedback**: The control will analyze the password as it is being typed and provide real-time feedback on its strength. The feedback will be shown through a color-coded indicator and a text label that describes the strength level.
2. **Password policy enforcement**: The control will enforce a set of password policies, such as minimum length, character set requirements, and complexity rules. If the password does not meet the policy requirements, the control will display a warning message to the user.
3. **Configurable policies**: The password policies will be configurable through properties exposed by the control. The user of the control will be able to set the minimum length, character set requirements, and complexity rules.
4. **Customizable UI**: The control will have a customizable UI, allowing the user of the control to choose the colors and styles of the feedback indicator and text label.
5. **Optional password reveal button**: The control will have an optional password reveal button that allows the user to toggle the password visibility between masked and unmasked.

## Architecture

The Password Strength Indicator control will consist of the following components:

1. **Password Strength Analyzer**: This component will analyze the password in real-time as it is being typed and provide a strength score and description.
2. **Password Policy Validator**: This component will validate the password against the specified password policies and provide a warning message if it does not meet the requirements.
3. **UI Components**: These components will display the real-time feedback, warning message, and password reveal button.

## Design

The Password Strength Indicator control will have a modern and intuitive design that is easy to use and understand. The control will consist of a single line input field where the user can enter their password. The real-time feedback will be displayed next to the input field in the form of a color-coded indicator and text label that describes the strength level. If the password does not meet the specified password policies, a warning message will be displayed below the input field. The optional password reveal button will be located at the end of the input field.

## Configuration

The Password Strength Indicator control will be highly configurable, allowing the user to customize the password policies and UI components. The following properties will be exposed by the control:

1. **MinimumLength**: The minimum length of the password (default: 8)
2. **RequireDigit**: Whether the password must contain at least one digit (default: true)
3. **RequireLowercase**: Whether the password must contain at least one lowercase letter (default: true)
4. **RequireUppercase**: Whether the password must contain at least one uppercase letter (default: true)
5. **RequireNonAlphanumeric**: Whether the password must contain at least one non-alphanumeric character (default: true)
6. **CustomValidation**: A custom validation function that takes a password string and returns a boolean indicating whether the password meets additional validation criteria (default: null)
7. **IndicatorColor**: The color of the strength indicator (default: green)
8. **WeakColor**: The color of the strength indicator when the password is weak (default: red)
9. **WarningColor**: The color of the warning message (default: orange)
10. **ShowPasswordRevealButton**: Whether to show the password reveal button (default: false)
11. **PasswordRevealButtonColor**: The color of the password reveal button (default: black)

## Technical Requirements

The Password Strength Indicator control will be developed using C# and WPF on the .NET Core v6.0 platform. The following technical requirements must be met:

1. **MVVM architecture**: The control will be implemented using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern.
2. **Real-time feedback**: The control will provide real-time feedback on the strength of the password as it is being typed.
3. **Password policies**: The control will enforce the specified password policies and display a warning message if the password does not meet the requirements.
4. **Customizable UI**: The control will have a customizable UI, allowing the user to choose the colors and styles of the feedback indicator and text label.
5. **Optional password reveal button**: The control will have an optional password reveal button that allows the user to toggle the password visibility between masked and unmasked.
6. **Unit testing**: The control will be thoroughly tested using unit tests to ensure that it works as expected.
7. **Documentation**: The control will be fully documented with clear and concise code comments and a user manual.

## Testing

The Password Strength Indicator control will be thoroughly tested using unit tests to ensure that it works as expected. The following tests will be performed:

1. **Real-time feedback**: The control will be tested to ensure that it provides real-time feedback on the strength of the password as it is being typed.
2. **Password policies**: The control will be tested to ensure that it enforces the specified password policies and displays a warning message if the password does not meet the requirements.
3. **Customizable UI**: The control will be tested to ensure that it has a customizable UI, allowing the user to choose the colors and styles of the feedback indicator and text label.
4. **Optional password reveal button**: The control will be tested to ensure that it has an optional password reveal button that allows the user to toggle the password visibility between masked and unmasked.
5. **Unit testing**: The control will be tested using unit tests to ensure that it works as expected.

## User Manual

The Password Strength Indicator control will be accompanied by a user manual that provides clear and concise instructions on how to use the control. The user manual will include the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: A brief overview of the control and its purpose.
2. **Installation**: Instructions on how to install the control.
3. **Usage**: Instructions on how to use the control, including how to set the password policies and customize the UI.
4. **Troubleshooting**: A list of common issues and their solutions.
5. **FAQ**: A list of frequently asked questions.

## Conclusion

The Password Strength Indicator control is an innovative and useful tool for enforcing password policies and providing real-time feedback to users. With its configurable password policies, customizable UI, and optional password reveal button, it provides a modern and intuitive user experience. By following the technical requirements and testing procedures outlined in this specification, the control will be a reliable and effective solution for password strength indication.
