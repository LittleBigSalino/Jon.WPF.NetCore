I'm writing a C# WPF .NET Core v6.0 user control; a ToggleSwitch Control - A control that allows the user to toggle a setting on or off, often used for simple binary settings like "on" and "off". The "on" and "off" text is a dependency property as well. Can you please generate a nicely formatted markdown of a detailed product build specification to fully implement the user control?
