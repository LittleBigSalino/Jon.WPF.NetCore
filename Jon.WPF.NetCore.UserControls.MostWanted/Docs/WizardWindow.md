## Installation

_TODO: Provide instructions for installing the library/package if applicable._

## Usage

To create a new wizard, follow these steps:

1. Create a new instance of the `WizardWindow` class.
2. Create instances of the built-in views or your custom views inheriting from `StepBase`.
3. Add the instances to the list of steps in the `WizardWindow`.
4. Call the `ShowDialog()` method on the `WizardWindow` instance to display the wizard.

Here's an example:

```csharp
var wizard = new WizardWindow(new List<StepBase>
{
    new WizardWindowWelcomeView("Welcome to the Most Wanted WPF Wizard!"),
    // ... Add more steps here ...
});

wizard.ShowDialog();
```

## Built-in Views

### WizardWindowWelcomeView

This view is typically used as the first screen of the wizard. It displays a nicely formatted text to welcome users.
