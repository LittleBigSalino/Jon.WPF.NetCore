# Time Picker Control Specification

The Time Picker control is a user interface component that allows users to select a specific time value within a given range. This control is implemented in WPF .NET Core v6.0 and provides a flexible and customizable way to pick time values in your applications.

## Features

- Allows selection of time values with a 12-hour or 24-hour clock format
- Provides support for setting a minimum and maximum time range
- Offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for selecting time values
- Displays time values in a customizable format
- Provides a number of customization options to allow developers to tailor the control to their specific needs
- Supports data binding and validation
- Includes an AM/PM toggle for the 12-hour clock format

## Usage

To use the Time Picker control in your application, simply add it to your XAML code:

```xml
<Window x:Class="MyApp.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:controls="clr-namespace:MyApp.Controls">
    <Grid>
        <controls:TimePicker />
    </Grid>
</Window>
```

By default, the Time Picker control will display time values in a 12-hour clock format. To change this to a 24-hour format, simply set the `Is24HourFormat` property to `true`:

```xml
<controls:TimePicker Is24HourFormat="True" />
```

## Properties

The following properties are available on the Time Picker control:

### `SelectedTime`

Gets or sets the currently selected time value. This property is of type `DateTime?`.

### `MinimumTime`

Gets or sets the minimum time value that can be selected. This property is of type `DateTime?`.

### `MaximumTime`

Gets or sets the maximum time value that can be selected. This property is of type `DateTime?`.

### `Is24HourFormat`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether the control should display time values in a 24-hour clock format. This property is of type `bool` and defaults to `false`.

### `TimeFormat`

Gets or sets the format string used to display time values. This property is of type `string` and defaults to `"h:mm tt"` for 12-hour format and `"HH:mm"` for 24-hour format.

## Customization

The Time Picker control provides a number of customization options to allow developers to tailor the control to their specific needs. The following properties are available for customization:

### `Background`

Gets or sets the background color of the control.

### `BorderBrush`

Gets or sets the brush used to draw the border of the control.

### `BorderThickness`

Gets or sets the thickness of the control's border.

### `FontFamily`

Gets or sets the font family used to display text in the control.

### `FontSize`

Gets or sets the font size used to display text in the control.

### `Foreground`

Gets or sets the foreground color of the control.

### `Padding`

Gets or sets the padding within the control.

### `Template`

Gets or sets the control's template. This property is of type `ControlTemplate`.

## Data Binding

The Time Picker control supports data binding to allow you to bind the control's properties to your application's data model. The following properties are available for data binding:

### `SelectedTime`

The `SelectedTime` property can be bound to a `DateTime?` property in your data model.

### `MinimumTime`

The `MinimumTime` property can be bound to a `DateTime?` property in your data model.

### `MaximumTime`

The `MaximumTime`property can be bound to a `DateTime?` property in your data model.

## Validation

The Time Picker control supports validation to ensure that the selected time value falls within a specified range. You can use the `ValidationRule` class to create custom validation rules for the control.

The following example shows how to create a validation rule that ensures the selected time value is within a specified range:

```csharp
public class TimeRangeValidationRule : ValidationRule
{
    public DateTime? Minimum { get; set; }
    public DateTime? Maximum { get; set; }

    public override ValidationResult Validate(object value, CultureInfo cultureInfo)
    {
        DateTime? time = value as DateTime?;
        if (time == null)
        {
            return new ValidationResult(false, "Invalid time value.");
        }

        if (Minimum != null && time.Value.TimeOfDay < Minimum.Value.TimeOfDay)
        {
            return new ValidationResult(false, "Time value is below the minimum allowed value.");
        }

        if (Maximum != null && time.Value.TimeOfDay > Maximum.Value.TimeOfDay)
        {
            return new ValidationResult(false, "Time value is above the maximum allowed value.");
        }

        return ValidationResult.ValidResult;
    }
}
```

To use this validation rule with the Time Picker control, add an instance of the rule to the control's `ValidationRules` collection:

```xml
<controls:TimePicker>
    <controls:TimePicker.ValidationRules>
        <local:TimeRangeValidationRule Minimum="{Binding MinTime}" Maximum="{Binding MaxTime}" />
    </controls:TimePicker.ValidationRules>
</controls:TimePicker>
```

## Conclusion

The Time Picker control provides a flexible and customizable way to pick time values in your WPF .NET Core v6.0 applications. With its support for data binding, validation, customization, and the added AM/PM toggle for the 12-hour format, you can easily tailor the control to your specific needs.
